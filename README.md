# IWP: Project No 2
# -----------------
#
# Completed features:
# -bootstrap
# -multiple map layers
# -layer control
# -drag and drop to add data
# -area (municipality) location
# -statistical functions for aggregating across all municipalities
# -search for municipalities
# -show complete data for municipality
# -responsiveness
#
# TBA:
# -query data i.e "show all that have less than this amount of education" etc. -> pain them in a color and/or list them
# -compare data
# -instead of drag n drop mobile GUI should use some other method (e.g click) to import the data
# -change accordion to more screen friendly for mobile
#
# Known bugs:
# -when attempting to export map data, if multiple municipalities have been clicked and map produced, multiple requests are made (when 
#  the most recent should only be printed)
