# IWP: Project No 2
# -----------------
#
# Completed features:
# -bootstrap
# -layer control
# -Additional map layers are already loaded OSM and Satellite
# -drag and drop to add data
# -area (municipality) location
# -statistical functions for aggregating across all municipalities
# -search for municipalities
#
# Missing features:
# -query data i.e "show all that have less than this amount of education" etc. -> pain them in a color and/or list them
# -compare data
# -add new data with drag n drop: this should be added as cross in the legend (on/off), and ALL selected should be shown in the
#  tooltip
# -compare two municipalities' stats (note that this has to make sense i.e not all data can be compared/contrasted) NOT DONE
# -LHS sidebar containts the data with the following structures:
# -Regional -> Choose regional data dropdown -> depending on the series chosen choose year, and/or variable e.g income, education
# -Municipalities -> Choose munipalities data dropdown -> depending on the series chosen choose year and/or variable e.g income,
#  education
